# Mancala

The goal of this project is to create a game of Mancala where the user can play against a computer AI that decides its moves with a MinMax heuristic search algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning.
Everything is coded in Python, and the PyGame library is used for the GUI and gameplay.

I'm currently working on more important and relevant projects, so this has been put on hold for the time being.
